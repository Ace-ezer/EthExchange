# EthExchange

A Decentralised application built by following one of the Tutorials of Dapp University. Using this Dapp user can buy Tokens in exchange for ether. These tokens then, can be used to interact with the rest of the Dapps made available by the owner.

#### This project followed the backend same as taught in the tutorial but the frontend is different and better from the tutorial.
